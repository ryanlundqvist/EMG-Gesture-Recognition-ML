What is an EMG (Electromyogram)?
- Bioelectrical signals generated by muscle cells when they are activated. 
- Captured using electrodes placed on a skin surface. 
  - In regards to our dataset, The Myo Thalmic bracelet captures signals from the forearm. It does this by utilizing 8 EMG sensors and a bluetooth module.

What is EMG Gesture Classification?
- Process in which electric signals gendered by muscle contractions are monitored inorder to identify specific gestures.

st.write("Consists of gesture EMG recordings from a bluetooth MYO Thalmic bracelet. Time based data with raw EMG output, where each ‚Äúdatapoint‚Äù is a static hand gesture held for 3 seconds with a 3 second pause between different gestures. We can classify a total of 7 gestures. Each gesture is not uniformly represented in the dataset.")

st.subheader("Problem", divider="blue")
st.write("Electromyography (EMG) data, captured from muscle movements, is an important source of info which allows us to develop and create systems and technology that can properly interpret hand gestures. With proper interpretation, EMG data is useful in aiding the development of prosthetics and nuanced rehabilitation techniques. However, raw EMG data remains inherently variable and quite complicated, therefore making it quite difficult to accurately read and classify hand gestures.")
st.subheader("Motivation", divider="blue")
st.write("Properly reading and interpreting EMG data has massive implications in physical rehabilitation and prosthetic developments, as it would allow us to better mimic natural and intuitive control of limbs, allowing those with amputations and disabilities greater independence and mobility in their lives. In this project, we will be exploring the use of ML to enhance the accuracy and reliability of hand gesture recognition, providing a foundation for real-world applications by tackling the inherent variability of EMG data.")
